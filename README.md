## Introduction

In this work, we introduce a document similarity-based graph convolutional network (DS-GCN) encoder to combine graph convolutional network and embedded topic model for text-rich network representation. Then, a latent position-based decoder is used to reconstruct the graph while preserving network topology. Similarly, the document matrix is rebuilt using a decoder that takes both topic and word embeddings into account. 

## Requirement

Pytorch

## Usage

run 'train.py'.
